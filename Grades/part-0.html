<div dir="ltr"><div>Hi All,</div><div><br></div><div>The Wumpus World Final Tournament has just concluded. As usual, the scoreboard and worlds are attached below. Additionally, I have included below the grading rubric that will be used to grade the Final AI assignment.</div><div><br></div><div>If you submitted your project on time and you can&#39;t find your team name on the scoreboard, please contact me as soon as possible.</div><div><br></div><div>My response time will be messy this week due to finals, but I will still be able to answer questions and concerns. I apologize in advance.</div><div><br></div><div>Remember, if you submit your assignment late, notify the teaching staff.</div><div><br></div><div>Final AI Rubric:</div><div><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Core Grade (50 points):</div><div><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>- Compiles on Openlab (5 points)</div><div><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>- Submitted a document report (upto 15 points)</div><div><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>- Executes successfully and scores &gt;= 200 (30 points)</div><div><span style="white-space:pre">			</span>- If your score is between 140 and 200:</div><div><span style="white-space:pre">				</span>- You will loose half a grade point (0.5 point) for every score point below 200 rounded in your favor. (i.e. score of 191 will loose floor(0.5*9) = 4 points)</div><div><br></div><div><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>Late Submission:</div><div><span style="white-space:pre">		</span>- Minus 10% per day late.

Out of fairness to students who submit late, only submissions with a score &gt;= 140 will be in the running for extra credit.</div><div><br></div><div>Well done everyone! I wish you all luck with your finals! This has been an amazing experience, and I have learned a lot from all of you. I hope that I have taught you all something new as well. Good luck on your Finals! Happy Holidays!</div><div><br></div><div>Your Tournament Director,</div><div>Abdullah Younis</div></div>
